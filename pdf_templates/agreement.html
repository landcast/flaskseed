			<p> THIS AGREEMENT executed on this the {{effective_date}} , but agreed to be effective from and after {{effective_date}},
				by and between Dandelion International Institute, LLC (hereinafter “Company”), and {{teacher_name}} (hereinafter “Contractor”).</p>

			<p> NOW, THEREFORE, FOR AND IN CONSIDERATION of the mutual promises and agreements contained herein, Company hires Contractor,
				and Contractor agrees to work for Company under the terms and conditions hereby agreed upon by the parties:</p>

			<p>SECTION 1 – WORK TO BE PERFORMED</p>

			<p>1.1 Term. Company agrees to hire Contractor, at will, for a term commencing on June 14, 2018 and
				continuing until terminated in accordance with Section 4.</p>

			<p>1.2 Duties. Contractor agrees to perform work for the Company on the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement,
				and agrees to devote all necessary time and attention (reasonable periods of illness accepted) to the performance of
				the duties specified in this agreement. Contractor’s duties shall be as follows:</p>

			<p> a. Contractor requires developing a 30-minute "Pre-Lesson Meeting" PowerPoint as part of a demo session for new prospective
				students to evaluate the teacher. The “Pre-Lesson Meeting” PowerPoint and the very first demo session are not reimbursable.
				Subsequent demo sessions are reimbursable at 1/2 hourly rate stated in Section 3.1 of this contract. All demo sessions
				are not to exceed 30 minutes. Additional minutes are not reimbursable and are at the discretion of the contractor. Regular
				sessions are paid according to the hourly rate stated in Section 3.1 of this contract. All demo and regular sessions
				require the contractor to complete a written session evaluation of the student and submitted no later than 24 hours after
				completion of a session.</p>

			<p> b. When a student has purchased your lesson package, the contractor must develop a “Teaching Plan” for that student and
				prepare PowerPoint for all sessions. “Teaching Plan” needs be updated regularly to adapt to student’s progress.</p>

			<p> c. PowerPoint must be submitted to the Program Manager at least 48 hours prior to the start of a session for review.</p>

			<p> d. Contractor is required to be online live, face to face teaching for a minimum of 50 minutes. Additional minutes are
				not reimbursable and are solely on Contractor's discretion. A completed session is 50 minutes live teaching and 10 minutes
				offline to complete the evaluation. </p>

			<p> 1.3 Cancel Class</p>

			<p> a. When a class session is booked, the contractor may cancel the session 24 hours before the class session starts without
				penalty. The contractor can make up the lesson at another time.</p>

			<p> b. If the contractor cancels the class session less than 24 hours’ notice, the contractor must make up the missed session
				without compensation. If the session is not made up, the penalty of a session's pay will be deducted from your next earnings.</p>

			<p> c. When a class session is booked and the student fails to cancel the class session in advance of a 24-hour notice, the
				contractor is entitled to a session's pay.</p>

			<p> 1.4 Tardiness</p>

			<p> a. If the contractor is late within 10 minutes of a class session, on the premise it does not affect the next scheduled
				class session, the contractor can make up the missed minutes in the same session or in another session.</p>

			<p> b. If the contractor is late for more than 10 minutes of a class session, it is viewed as canceling a class session within
				24 hours. The contractor must make up the missed class session without compensation.</p>

			<p> c. If the student is more than 10 minutes late to a class session, it is considered the student has forfeited the class
				and the contractor is entitled to a full session pay.</p>

			<p> 1. 5 Absence</p>

			<p> Absence from class is the same method of disposition as late for more than 10 minutes.</p>

			<p> 1.6 Missing Time</p>

			<p> If the contractor contributed to the reasons that a class is not in session for the full 50 minutes, contractor must make
				up the loss time to the student. Loss time must be made up before payment can be made.</p>

			<p> 1.7 Contractor further agrees that in all such aspects of such work, Contractor shall comply with the policies, standards,
				regulations of the Company from time to time established, and shall perform the duties assigned faithfully, intelligently,
				to the best of his/her/their ability, and in the best interest of the Company.</p>

			<p> SECTION 2 – CONFIDENTIALITY</p>

			<p> 2.1 Confidentiality. Contractor acknowledges and agrees that all financial and accounting records, lists of property owned
				by Company, including amounts paid therefore, client and customer lists, and other Company data and information related
				to its business (hereinafter collectively “Confidential Information”) are valuable assets of the Company. Except for
				disclosures required to be made to advance the business of the Company and information which is a matter of public record,
				Contractor shall not, during the term of this Agreement or after the termination of this Agreement, disclose any Confidential
				Information to any person or use any Confidential Information for the benefit of Contractor or any other person, except
				with the prior written consent of the Company.</p>

				lists, plans, memoranda, notes and other documentation related to the business of the Company or containing any Confidential
				Information shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and shall be returned to the Company upon the termination
				of this Agreement or upon the written request of the Company.</p>

			<p> 2.3 Injunction. Contractor agrees that it would be difficult to measure damage to the Company from any breach by Contractor
				of Section 2.1 or 2.2 and that monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy for such breach. Accordingly, Contractor
				agrees that if Contractor shall breach Section 2.1 or 2.2, the Company shall be entitled to, in addition to all other
				remedies it may have at law or equity, to an injunction or other appropriate orders to restrain any such breach, without
				showing or proving actual damages sustained by the Company.</p>

				of income taxes and other employment taxes. Contractor shall be solely responsible for reporting and paying any such
				taxes. The Company shall not provide Contractor with any coverage or participation in the Company’s accident and health
				insurance, life insurance, disability income insurance, medical expense reimbursement, wage continuation plans, or other

				shall pay to Contractor’s estate the salary which would otherwise be payable to Contractor.</p>

			<p> SECTION 5 – INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS</p>

			<p> Contractor acknowledges that he is an independent contractor and is not an agent, partner, joint venture nor employee
				of Company. Contractor shall have no authority to bind or otherwise obligate Contractor in any manner nor shall Contractor

				form any such loss or damage.</p>

			<p> SECTION 6 – REPRESENTATIONS OF WARRANTIES OF CONTRACTOR</p>
